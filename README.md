### Welcome to my little corner of work! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm **Nga** , a 4th-year student with a passion for web programming. I am currently studying Computer Science specializing in web development.

I have over 6 months of experience working on significant Java projects as a backend developer. During my internship, I gained valuable hands-on experience in Java programming and had the opportunity to work on various projects. This experience has allowed me to enhance my software development skills, problem-solving abilities, and collaboration within teams.

I am always eager to seek out new opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to more projects. 

<!-- If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me at ngachann02@gmail.com. I am excited about potential collaborations and personal growth opportunities! -->
