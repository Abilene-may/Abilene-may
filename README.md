### Welcome to my little corner of work! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is **Nga**, Iâ€™m a senior student at the University, majoring in Computer Science. Iâ€™m really interested in web development.

I have been working as a backend developer using Java programming language for more than 6 months. During intern time, I gained valid hands-on experience in Java programming language and had chain to challenge myself on various projects. This experience has facilitated me to enhance my career as well as other skills including problem-solving, software, collaboration within teams.

I am always eager to seek out new opportunities to develop further skills.
